TechCon 2023 Website - Frontend Development
Overview
This project is the front-end development for the TechCon 2023 website. It showcases my skills in web development by creating a multi-page, responsive, and interactive website for managing a technical conference. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery implemented to enhance interactivity.

The goal of the project is to provide a seamless user experience with easy navigation, smooth interactions, and well-organized content across multiple pages.

Project Pages
The website includes the following pages:

Home Page (index.html): Provides general information about the TechCon 2023 event.
Registration Page (register.html): Features a registration form where attendees can sign up for the event.
Schedule Page (schedule.html): Displays a detailed schedule of the conference, including dates, times, and event breakdowns.
Speakers Page (speakers.html): Lists the event speakers along with their bios and presentation topics.
Contact Page (contact.html): Contains a contact form and the necessary details for reaching out regarding the conference.
Features
Multi-Page Structure
The website is structured as a multi-page layout with the following core pages:

index.html for the home page
register.html for the registration form
schedule.html for the event schedule
speakers.html for speaker information
contact.html for inquiries and contact details
Navigation
Each page features a consistent navigation menu to ensure a smooth user experience across the site. The navigation bar is responsive and adjusts based on screen size, making it user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Responsiveness
To cater to a wide range of devices, I implemented responsive design using CSS media queries. This ensures that the website layout adjusts based on the screen size, providing an optimal experience whether the user is on a mobile device or a desktop computer.

Interactivity with JavaScript and jQuery
I used JavaScript and jQuery to add dynamic features and interactivity across the website. Examples of interactivity include:

Form validation on the registration and contact pages.
Dynamic schedule interactions such as collapsing sections to improve readability.
Smooth scrolling between page sections when navigating via the menu.
Tools and Technologies
HTML5: For structuring the content of the pages.
CSS3: For styling the website, ensuring a modern and clean layout with responsiveness across devices.
JavaScript/jQuery: For adding interactive elements, such as form validation and dynamic page behavior.
Git: Version control for managing and tracking the development process.
GitHub: For hosting and sharing the project.
Challenges and Solutions
Responsive Design
The biggest challenge I faced was ensuring that the website was fully responsive across various devices. I used media queries to adjust font sizes, layout structures, and navigation elements to provide an optimal experience on both small and large screens.

Form Validation
Implementing robust client-side form validation for the registration and contact forms was essential to ensure that users provide correct and complete information. Using jQuery helped streamline this process by offering built-in validation functions.

Future Improvements
Backend Integration: The next step for this project would be to implement backend functionality for user registration and contact submissions.
Enhanced Interactivity: I plan to add more advanced interactive features, such as live updates for the conference schedule and speaker presentations.
